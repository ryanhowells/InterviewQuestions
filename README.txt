Please go through each class in this solution, answering all questions as you go along. If you do not understand a question or aren't sure on how to answer it, there will not be a penalty for skipping it.

Questions are asked in code comments at the top of every class, outlining the scenarios that we would like you to cover.

If there are any remarks you want to make about how you have answered each question, please add them as comments in each class. An explanation of "why" will be just as interesting as the code showing "how" you have answered each question.

You are permitted to add any references from nuget or any other code sources that you see fit. Answers may add classes, methods, properties or any other code that you as a candidate feel necessary.

There are multiple ways of answering the vast majority of these questions, your code will be read through at the end and evaluated against how you went about answering these questions just as much as whether the code would do what the question asks.

Feel free to use google, or any other internet resource you see fit in this answer. However this should be used as a reference for things that you have forgotten about, instead of learning new technology. If the question is on a topic you have not covered before, there will not be a penalty for skipping it.

Once you have answered the questions, we will arrange a short call to talk through and discuss any interesting questions/answers.
